Slept well—breakfasted clear up to my adams apple—took shawl strap and went to Boston with Damon with following memorandum of things to get. Lavatar on the human face—Miss Clevelands book—Helosie by Rosseau—short neckties—Wilhelm Meister—Basket fruit—Sorrows of Werther—Madam Recamiers works—Diary books—pencils■Telephone documents■Mark Twains gummed Potentiality of Literature ie scrap book.—also book called "How success is won" containing life of Dr Vincent & something in about Minas father and your humble servitor. Found that only copy of Lavatar which I saw the other day had been sold to some one who was on the same lay as myself■Bought Disraeli's Curriosities of Literature instead—  Got Miss Cs book—Twains scrap book—Diary books, How Success is Won also fruit among which are some peaches which the vendor said came from California think

of a lie 3000 miles long—There seemed to be a South Carolina accent in their taste— Started back to office with fruit, apparantly by the same route I came, brought up in a strange street saw landmark and got on right course again■Boston ought to be buoyed and charts furnished strangers— Damon suggests American District Messenger buoys with uniform—Saw a lady who looked like Mina—got thinking about Mina and came near being run over by a street car—  If Mina interferes much more I will have to take out an accident policy—  Went to dinner at a sort of No-bread-with-one-fishball restaurant then came up towards Damons office, met Damon Madden and Ex Gov Howard of Rhode Island.

This story would have Embarassed Satan  I shall not relate it, but I have called it "Prepositums Turkish Compromise"■Hovey told me a lot about a 6th sense, mind reading etc

Mrs R is a charming woman Condensed sunshine beautiful plays piano like a long haired professor played several of Lange's pieces first time seeing them.  This seems so incomprehensible to me as a man reciting the Lords prayer in four languages simultaneously Mrs R promised to come tomorrow evening and bring with her a lady who sings beautifully and a boy dripping with music made some suggestions about Railroad Telegraph Came home with Damon at 5 oclock Damon has an ulcerated molar Just before supper Mrs Roberts and another lady came in to visit Mrs G.Mrs R is a charming woman Condensed sunshine beautiful plays piano like a long haired professor played several of Lange's pieces first time seeing them.
